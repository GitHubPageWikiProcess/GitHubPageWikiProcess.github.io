They are nearly identical, but there are a few important differences between them**.**\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n![](http://blog.efpsa.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/survey-2-300x288.jpg)\r\n\r\n\r\nBoth types of GitHub Pages are served over HTTP, not HTTPS. That doesn't make them inherently less secure, but it does mean that you shouldn't use them for sensitive transactions, like sending passwords or credit card numbers.\r\n\r\nUser & Organization Pages\r\n\r\nUser & Organization Pages live in a special repository dedicated to GitHub Pages files. You will need to name this repository with the account name, e.g. atmos/atmos.github.io\r\n\r\nYou must use the username/username.github.io naming scheme.\r\nContent from the master branch will be used to build and publish your GitHub Pages site.\r\nTip: You can only use your own account name for a User or Organization Page repository. A repository like joe/bob.github.io will not build a User Pages site.\r\nTip: If you would like to use Pages on GitHub Enterprise, note that:\r\n\r\nyou must replace all instances of github.io in this article with your Enterprise hostname\r\nyour Pages sites will be served at a subdirectory (e.g. http(s)://[hostname]/pages/[user or organization name]) instead of a subdomain (e.g. http://[user or organization name].github.io)\r\nProject Pages\r\n\r\nUnlike User and Organization Pages, Project Pages are kept in the same repository as their project. These GitHub Pages are similar to User and Organization Pages, with a few slight differences:\r\n\r\nThe gh-pages branch is used to build and publish Project Pages sites.\r\nIf no custom domain is used, the Project Pages sites are served under a subpath of the User Pages site: username.github.io/projectname\r\nA custom domain on User and Organization Pages sites applies the same domain redirect to all Project Pages sites hosted under that account. Project Pages sites that use a custom domain are also available at username.github.io/projectname.\r\nCustom 404s will only work if a custom domain is used. Otherwise, the User Page 404 is used.\r\nTip: Enterprise Project Pages sites will be served at a subdirectory (e.g. http(s)://[hostname]/pages/[user or organization name]/projectname) instead of a subdomain (e.g. http://[user or organization name].github.io/projectname)\r\ncontact a human\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
